### this is very experimental code, it has barely been tested and I don't really even know what I am doing.
### Use it with caution and at your own risk.  It seriously might not work right.
### It will kill any running instance of witness_node and relaunch witness_node in a new screen named witness
### there is a delay between launching the witness_node and launching the cli_wallet.  This is to give your witness node enough time to open up and get ready to accept the connection
### from your cli_wallet.  It is currently set to 3 minutes for a --replay and 5 minutes for a --resync.  You can modify these wait times on lines 27 and 82 of switch.py
